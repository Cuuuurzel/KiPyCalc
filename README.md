KiPyCalc
========

A programmable scientific calculator. Written in pure python using kivy and sympy. 
The program does no more than sending some input code to an istance of the python interpreter running a custom version of sympy.
Just this thing is the main point, it allows you to run python script in the calculator.
The gui is designed to run in portrait mode on android, but it is fully cross platform.
The program is also able to plot some graphics.
