KiPyCalc
========

A programmable scientific calculator. Written in pure python using kivy and sympy. The program does no more than sending some input code to the python interpreter. Just this last thing is the main point, it allows you to program the calculator using python. The gui is mint to run in portrait mode on android, but it is fully cross platform.
