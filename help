[size=16]First of all, I want to thank you for downloading my app, 
every single user is important for me, 
feel completely free to contact me for any question, 
issues, or suggestion![/size]

[size=20]Basic Usage[/size]
To be more pragmatic, let's start immediately.
The shift button allows you to change the meaning of the bottons.
All the calculations are made in symbolic mode, 
the evalf buttons give you a value : 
    a = 2 * pi        
    a              prints "2*pi"
    evalf( a )     prints "6.28..."
Declaring a function is also simple :
    f = x**3 * sin(x)
and then write 'f' to refer to the function, for example
    integrate( f, x )
or simply type 'f' and the press plot, good look!

[size=20]KiPyCalc base concept[/size]
I'm currently studing IT at shool.
That means essenctially function analisys for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 
and frequent tasks with complex number.
The basic combination of programming and calculations is a Programmable Calculator.
Unfortunately this kind of tool costs a lot, so why don't make your phone become one?
Fortunately, my being megalomaniac gave me an idea :
[size=18]Why emulate a calculator when I can provide the user a full Python interpreter?[/size]

[size=20]What is Python, and why you should care[/size]
Python is a pretty famous programming language, it is oop, it is portable, and it is interpretated.
That means, to be simple, there is someone, the Python Interpreter,
that takes your input and executes it.
The main advantage is that you can use the Python syntax, for example :
( I know, this is a stupid example, but be compassionate )[size=15]
    print( "Hello World!" )[/size]
Or, more useful -maybe-, you can define your own functions : [size=15]
    def factorials( x ) :
        f = 1
        while x > 1 :
            f = f * x
            x = x - 1
        return f [/size]
And the use is as simple as this :[size=15]
    factorials( 6 ) [/size]
