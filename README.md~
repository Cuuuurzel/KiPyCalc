KiPyCalc
========

A programmable scientific calculator. Written in pure python using kivy and sympy. 
The program does no more than sending some input code to an istance of the python interpreter running a custom version of sympy.
Just this thing is the main point, it allows you to run python script in the calculator.
The gui is designed to run in portrait mode on android, but it is fully cross platform.
The program will soon be able to plot some graphics.


Differences from sympy "standard" version :
 - "plotting" package deleted, it will be rewrited using kivy
 - addes some units of measure ( pico, nano, micro, milli, Kilo, Mega, Giga, Peta ), 
   so it is no more needed to slowly import the "physics" package in not user of interest.
 - "evalf" method of the "EvalfMixin" class default parameters values modified ( now less accuray by dedault )
