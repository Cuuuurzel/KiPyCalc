# Hello user!
# This is the script that KiPyCalc calls to initialize the shell.
# As you can see, this is a simply python script, feel free to modify it all if you want.
# ( I hope you won't touch anything if you don't know what python is. )

# Here is the source code of the application -> https://github.com/Cuuuurzel/KiPyCalc
